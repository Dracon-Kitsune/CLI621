CLI621

CLI621 is an e621.net downloader for the command line interface. It accepts
tasks and downloads requested content from e621.net. It is still in development
and more features will be added soon.

Usage
  Just switch into bin/ and use ./post or make a symlink of bin/post into your
  search path, like /usr/bin.

Install
  Just copy .e621/ into your home directory and put your user name and password
  into passwd.json. There is no anonymous login possible at this moment.
