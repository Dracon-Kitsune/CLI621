CLI621 v 0.1.1

CLI621 is an e621.net downloader for the command line interface. It accepts
tasks and downloads requested content from e621.net. It is still in development
and more features will be added soon.

Usage
  Just switch into bin/ and use ./post or make a symlink of bin/post into your
  search path, like /usr/bin.

Install
  Just copy .e621/ into your home directory and put your user name and password
  into passwd.json. There is no anonymous login possible at this moment.

Versioning
  CLI621 follows the common MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH pattern, where PATCHes don't add
  new features, MINOR updates add new features and are backwards compatible and
  MAJOR updates add new features, but are not backwards compatible.

Branches
  Stable versions get their own branch now. Master will always be considered
  unstable and copied into a new branch, when a minor release is ready. Check
  out "stable-releases/" to find out about the newest version!
  Stable means that it runs on the author's system smoothly and she did not find
  any major bugs!
